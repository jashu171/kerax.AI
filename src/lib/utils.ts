    { start: 10, end: 16, speaker: 'Charlie', text: 'Absolutely. And along with that, basic profile management â€“ letting users update their email and password.' },
    { start: 16, end: 22, speaker: 'Alice', text: 'Good point, Charlie. What about the main functionality? For the \'Meeting Scribe\' app, transcription has to be core.' },
    { start: 22, end: 28, speaker: 'Bob', text: 'Right. We need the ability to upload an audio file and get a text transcript back. Speaker diarization would be a huge plus for V1.' },

  summary: 'The team discussed core features for the V1 of the Meeting Scribe app, focusing on user authentication, profile management, and audio transcription. There was debate on whether to include speaker diarization in the initial release, with Alice favoring inclusion despite potential technical challenges.',
  actionPoints: [
    'Bob: Investigate transcription APIs with built-in diarization.',
    'Charlie: Start on the UI mockups for these features.'
  ],
  keyTakeaways: [
    'V1 core features include User Authentication (Login/Register) and basic Profile Management.',
    'Audio upload and transcription are core features, with speaker diarization as a desired feature for V1 pending API capabilities.'
